# The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Data Lake

_A comprehensive guide on key considerations involved in building your enterprise data lake_

[Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) is a highly scalable and cost-effective data lake solution for big data analytics. As we continue to work with our customers to unlock key insights out of their data using ADLS Gen2, we have identified key considerations and best practices that help them effectively utilize ADLS Gen2 in large scale Big Data platform architectures.

This document captures these best practices and considerations that we have learnt based on working with our customers. For the purposes of this document, we will focus on the Modern Data Warehouse pattern used prolifically by our large-scale enterprise customers on Azure , including our solutions such as Azure Synapse Analytics.

We will improve this document to include more analytics patterns in future iterations.
